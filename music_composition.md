# Schism Tracker
Schism Tracker is a free and open source reimplementation of [Impulse Tracker](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki/Impulse-Tracker), a program to create high quality music without the requirements
of specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique "finger feel" that is difficult to replicate in part. The player is based on a highly modified version of the [Modplug](https://openmpt.org/legacy_software)
engine, with number of bugfixes and changes to [improve IT playbook](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki/Player-abuse-tests).

Where Impulse Tracker was limited to i386-based systems running MS-DOS, Schism Tracker runs on almost any platform that [SDL 2](https:www.libsdl.org/index.php) supports. Current Builds are provided for Linux,
Mac OS X, and Windows. Most development is currently done on 64-bit Linux. Schism will most likely build on _any_architecture supported by GCC4 (e.g. alpha, m68k, arm, etc.) but it will probably not be as well
optimized on many systems.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki) for more information.

## Download
The latest stable builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux are available from [the releases page](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/releases.). Builds can also be installed from some distro repositories
on Linux, but these versions may not have the latest bug fixes and enhancements. Other build for the other platforms can be found on the wiki page.
Installing via Homebrew on macOS is no longer recommended, as the formula for Schism Tracker is not supported or maintained by anyone directly involved in the project.
